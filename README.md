## Introduction

This project features a 3D model of a robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom. Designed for educational and experimental purposes, the arm offers extensive motion capabilities. The STL file is provided for easy 3D printing, and the modular design allows for straightforward assembly and modification.

## Features

- 5 Degrees of Freedom
- STL File for 3D Printing
- Modular Design

## Requirements

- 3D Printer
- PLA filament or suitable 3D printing material
- Basic tools for assembly (screwdriver, screws, etc.)
- [STL File](https://github.com/xd7fx/3D.design.robot.leg/blob/e90d82ee7f02cbcf1bbf153b3436d0bf28c9736f/robot%203D%20with%20servo%20motors.stl)

## Installation

### Printing Instructions

1. **Download the STL File:** Ensure you have the `Robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom.stl` file.
2. **Load the File:** Open the STL file in your preferred slicing software (e.g., Cura, PrusaSlicer).
3. **Configure the Printer:** Set the printing parameters according to your printer's specifications.
4. **Start Printing:** Begin the printing process and wait for the model to be printed.
5. **Assembly:** Once all parts are printed, follow the assembly instructions to put together the robotic arm.

## Usage

1. **Connect Servos:** Attach servo motors to the designated joints on the robotic arm.
2. **Arduino Setup:** Connect the servo motors to an Arduino board and upload the control code.
3. **Test Movements:** Run basic test scripts to ensure all joints are moving correctly.
